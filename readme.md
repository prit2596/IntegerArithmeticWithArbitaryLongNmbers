# Project Title

Integer arithmetic with arbitrarily large numbers

## Project Description

In this project, a program that implements arithmetic with large integers, of arbitrary size is developed. The program works for any base arithmetic operations. The program also convert infix to postfix expressions.

The arithmetic operations are as follows: add, subtract, divide, product, power, mod, squareroot and base conversion. Various algorithms like like **Shunting Yard**, **Karatsuba Multiplication**, **Binary Search** are implemented in this project.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
1. Download and Install JDK software
2. Set Environment Variable
```

## How to execute code

NOTE: while executing from command prompt, the pwd should be the directory containing the directory ypp170130

**Compile the BaseMismatchException.java by executing the following command**
```
javac ypp170130/BaseMismatchException.java
```

**Compile the Num.java by executing the following command**
```
javac ypp170130/Num.java
```

**To execute the main(driver) code**
```
java ypp170130/Num
```

## Sample Output

```
A: 100
B: 5
Result of A/B: 20
Result of A*B: 500
Infix expression: 9/3+7-(5*1)
Result:5
```
